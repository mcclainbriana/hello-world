Test Github Repo

Hello! This is me getting acclimated to Github in hopes that I can navigate pretty well at the Hackathon in a few weeks as well as at my job moving forward. This is a pretty sweet open source tool to have access to. 

I like tacos. I have a fiance named Courtney and a dog named Broccoli. I am a data scientist by trade and the only reason I am still typing is because I am afraid to "COMMIT". Get it? See what I did there? Hah
